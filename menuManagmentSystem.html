								<b>Language:</b> HTML/CSS and C# (ASP.NET framework)<br>
								<b>Group size:</b> 3 <br>
								<b>Responsibility:</b> Front-end <br>
								<b>Lesson:</b> I developed team skills and learned new technologies while in a fast paced environment.
							</p>
							<p>A web application developed for DubHacks 2022 in a team of 3 people. It was intended for use in a kiosk as a menu for customers.
								The owner of the restaurant is able to register and log in to create their menu for the customer. The webapp can then go into 
								"presentation mode" which is what the customer sees.
							</p>
							<p>
								My role in this project was working on the front-end and it was my introduction to using HTML and CSS together to form static webpages.
								I worked closely with the backend developer on my team to learn and include ASP.NET elements in the front-end of the webapp, this 
								allowed for communication to the back-end. With only 24hrs to develop the application, communication and clear responsibilities were
								imperative to meeting the deadline.
							</p>
							<p>
								By far the most interesting aspect of this project was working on the navigation bars and
								menu section in a way that allowed categories and items to be dynamically added and removed by the owner. I think this was
								a very useful idea to practice since it is seen across many other websites and webapps.
								I am excited to learn more foundational front-end skills such as these to develop some standout web-apps.
