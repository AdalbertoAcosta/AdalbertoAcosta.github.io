								<b>Language:</b> Javascript (React Native framework) <br>
								<b>Group size:</b> 4 <br>
								<b>Responsibility:</b> Back-end <br>
								<b>Lesson:</b> I learned the value of user experience while developing the back-end of a mobile application.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dollar Scholar was a mobile application developed in a team of 4 with the purpose of helping the user
								track the difference between what they budgeted and spent on certain categories. It consists of 3 pages that allow the user to review spending,
								write down transactions, and set monthly budgets.
							</p>
							<p>
								My main responsibility in this app was developing the back-end which consisted of the Expo SQLite library (API layer) interacting with an SQLite database.
								This application went through various stages of designing and drafting; I contributed to all of them and led others. Some parts of the design process included 
								a mood board, persona, navigation diagram, wireframe, and relational database diagram. 
							</p>
							<p>
								This application was my introduction to back-end development and taught me a lot of valuable lessons. One of these lessons was considering the user perspective
								very carefully before and throughout development. This allows you to do a much better job of meeting their expectations. I really look forward
								to learning more Javascript and developing some very satisfying mobile apps.
